### Description

Fore those who are interested: 84 functions to manipulate a picture. To speed things up, GetPixel and Setpixel is used. Note that not all functions can be manipulated in the program, but it is just to show you how things are done... Anyway, all functions (in fact they are just mods, 'cause they have no return) can be found in the module. The manipulations go from "normal" (like emboss) to very complexe deformations. Only for the advanced! See screenshot.
